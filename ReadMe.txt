Hi Nick.
Considering that this was the first time that I had to work with AJAX and API I had to document myself from the very beginning once I understood what technology I had to use to complete the task.
I then started looking at syntax and methodology related to GET, POST and authentication with API.
This was the most time-consuming part considering a large number of different methodology to archive the same result and a large number of articles related to a different kind of API.
Once I have found the right syntax the rest of the task has been pretty straightforward.
As references, I have used Stak Overflow MDN and a few tutorials related to AJAX.
I`ll see you today at 15:00 PM.
Best Regards
Lorenzo Lando
